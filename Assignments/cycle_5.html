                To make the board I started by finding a photo of the board that I wanted on the internet. I then copied and pasted it onto adobe illustrator. I then rasterized the image and converted it to black and white.  Next, I created a square around the picture with the lines being a width of 0.01 mm. I then saved the file and emailed it to the computer connected to the laser cutter. Then I set up the machine by setting the start point and inputting the specifications for cutting wood. I then initiated the cut and waited within the tape box for the cut to finish.

                After finishing the laser cut element of the project, I started on the 3d printed element. When making the pieces for the board game I started by sketching out the shape of the pieces. Then I used the extrude tool to create the piece. I then sent it over to PrusaSlicer and saved the gcode. Then for the turn table, I created two wide cylinders. I then made one cylinder and put it in the center of one of the wider cylinders. I then used the hole tool to put a hole into the cylinder. Then I created another cylinder in the center of the wide cylinder that was slightly smaller than the hole so they could spin. I then put the gcode on flash drives and printed them on the 3d printers.

                The game that I made is called Hnefatafl which is a Norwegian board game that is also known as the Viking game. I made the board able to spin so that you could see all possible perspectives of the board. This allows the players to make the best move. Here is a link to the a youtube video of the final project. https://youtu.be/bGpcEOa8wJg
