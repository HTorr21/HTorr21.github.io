               When making an Audino circuit I first set up the circuit on Tinker Cad. I first made the negative line on the bread board by connecting it to the ground port on the Audino. I then added three lights to the breadboard. Then I connected the negative wire to the ground line with a resistor in between. For two of the lights, I then connected the positive power to spots 2 and 12 on the Audino. This completed the circuit for the two lights which would allow power to successfully flow through it. On the third light I added a button which allowed for power to flow through the circuit except when the button is pushed which would break the connection and sever the flow of power. I connected the positive power to 3 for the button circuit.

                When coding pin 12 I made it so that it would have low light for one second and then high light for a second which would create it to blink. For pin 2 I made it so that it would have high light for a second and then low light for a second. This would make it so that pins 12 and 2 would be alternating lights blinking when the other is off. For pin 3 I allowed for a constant flow of power that would be broken when the button was hit. This would turn off the light. I then recreated the circuit from Tinker Cad using the real components. Then I exported the code from my computer to the Arduino and successfully recreated the circuit from Tinker Cad.
