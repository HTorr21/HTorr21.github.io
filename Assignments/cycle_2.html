                To begin I used the sketch tool to sketch out the hexagon shape of my box. Then I utilized the extrude tool to extend the shape out. Then I used the shell tool to hollow it out that there was an open space. Then I used the create cylinder tool to create a central pillar inside the box. I gave it a diameter of 17.80mm so that a ring would fit around it. I then used the sketch tool again to trace out the inside of the hollow hexagon.

                I then used the extrude tool to give that sketched shape some volume. I then used the chamfer of the edges of that shape to give its diamond like appearance. I then used the hole tool to add a hole with a 4mm diameter to both the cylinder and the bottom of the lid about 2mm deep. This hole was just big enough to snugly fit the magnets. This allows for the lid to connect to the central pillar.

               I then opened the file on slicer and converted it so that I could download it onto a USB. I printed on one of the minis and the print took a total of 2 hours and 8 minutes. Once the print had finished, I put the magnets in place. With that the box was completed.          </p>
