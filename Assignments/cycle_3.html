                In order to make the mountain sun decal I first made the triangles using the star tool after specifying 3 points. Then after making 3 triangles, I grouped them together to create the mountains. I then added another layer and on it used the ellipse tool to make a circle that would be the sun. I then moved the mountains over the sun and then traced the mountain with the eraser tool so that there would be an increased space between the mountains and the sun. I then saved the two layers individually as svg files. I then exported the two files one at a time to the cutting program and started the cut. After the cut was completed, I removed the excess vinyl. I then used the heat press to put down the mountains onto a shirt. I then put the sun in place and used the heat press again. This left the final product of the mountain sun decal in place on the shirt.

                To make the ghost sticker I first used the ellipse tool to create a circle. I then used the add point tool and direct select tool to shape the circle into a ghost. I then used the ellipse tool to create another circle and then the direct select tool to create an oval. I then copied and paste it so I had two I placed these ovals as eyes and then used the remove back tool so that they would not have anything behind them so that they could stick to the surface they were placed on instead of the sticker that shaped the ghost. I then created them into two separate layers in order to have two different colors and saved the two layers as svg files. I then exported them to the cutting program and started the two cuts. After I had the two layers cut out of vinyl, I removed the excess vinal. I then placed transfer paper over the two. After transferring the vinyl over to transfer paper I applied them to the new surface and used a card to complete the transfer and ensure that no bubbles were formed under the sticker.
