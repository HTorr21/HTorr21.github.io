                Hi! My name is Hartley Torrison and I am in the class of 2026. I am taking this class because it was something that I was interested in learning more about. I have some experience using lazer printer but that was years ago. I look forward to getting to create and learn in this class.
                <br><br>
                I am from Connecticut though I lived in Colorado for about 5 Years. In my free time I like to make jewlery, fish, write, and watch tv. I am very excited for House of Dragons to be coming out because I was obssessed with Game of Thrones.

        <div class="sideImage">
            <p class="text">
                Here is a photo of me being forced into a hat against my will that was taken at Target.
                <br><br>
                You may also notice that the first image of Howie is a vertical orientation whereas the second photo is horizontal. Take a look at the code and the class of each image. The CSS is written such that you specify the orientation of the image to ensure it fills the whole square! You're welcome!
            </p>
            <div class="smallImageDiv right">
                <img class="smallImage horizontal" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vUG99OwY4s8B1omVGhRwSA30g4lStg1TSOUegPNWj8dV6D6x7LyCJsAPSjZRTCGaDcQ=w2400">

        </div>

        <div class="noImage">
            <p class="text">
                Lastly, this is to show you how to create a section of text with no images. Once again, you may add to this section, or delete it entirely. I can keep typing and typing and typing and the text will automatically create a newline as needed!
