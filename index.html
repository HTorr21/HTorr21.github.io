                Hi! My name is Hartley Torrison and I am in the class of 2026. I am taking this class because it was something that I was interested in learning more about. I have some experience using lazer printer but that was years ago. I look forward to getting to create and learn in this class.
                <br><br>
                I am from Connecticut though I lived in Colorado for about 5 Years. In my free time I like to make jewlery, fish, write, and watch tv. I am very excited for House of Dragons to be coming out because I was obssessed with Game of Thrones.

                I have quite a few pets at home. I have 3 cats, 2 dogs, 8 chickens, and an unknown amount of fish. I also used to have a lizard but I gave it to my cousin before I left for college.
